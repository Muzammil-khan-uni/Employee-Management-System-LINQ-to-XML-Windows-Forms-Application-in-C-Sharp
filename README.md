This project is a Windows Forms Application developed in C# (.NET Framework) that demonstrates how to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on an XML file using LINQ to XML. It is designed to manage employee records in a simple and user-friendly way, using an XML file (employees.xml) as the storage medium instead of a traditional database.

üéØ Project Objectives:

To practice and demonstrate the use of LINQ to XML for data manipulation.

To build a simple and lightweight employee management system.

To develop an interactive and functional GUI using Windows Forms.

To store, retrieve, update, and delete data persistently using an XML file.

‚öôÔ∏è Key Functionalities:

1. Load XML File:

On clicking the ‚ÄúLoad XML‚Äù button, the application attempts to load the employees.xml file.

If the file does not exist, it automatically creates a new one with a root <Employees> element.

2. Display Employees:

The employees are fetched using a LINQ query from the XML file and displayed in a DataGridView.

The fields include: ID, Name, Age, Salary, Designation, and Company.

3. Add New Employee:

Users can input new employee data in textboxes and click ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù to insert a new <Employee> element into the XML file.

The UI is updated automatically to reflect the new record.

4. Update Existing Employee:

Users can select a record from the DataGridView to populate the input fields.

After editing the fields, clicking ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù will modify the corresponding employee data in the XML file.

5. Delete Employee:

Users can delete an employee by providing their ID and clicking the ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù button.

The employee node is removed from the XML, and the grid is updated.

6. Save XML:

The ‚ÄúSave XML‚Äù button explicitly saves the current state of the XML file to disk.

7. Clear Inputs:

The ‚ÄúClear‚Äù button clears all input fields for ease of use.
